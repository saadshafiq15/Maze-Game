# Maze-Game
I recently created a Python program that is a maze game. In this game, players navigate through a series of interconnected rooms and corridors, trying to find their way to the end of the maze.

To create the game, I used the Python programming language and a variety of libraries and frameworks. I also utilized object-oriented programming concepts to design the game's mechanics.

In the game, players respond to prompts to move their character through the maze. They can collect items, solve puzzles, and avoid obstacles as they make their way to the final goal. 

Overall, creating the Python maze game was a fun and rewarding project that allowed me to apply my programming skills and create a unique and engaging game experience.
